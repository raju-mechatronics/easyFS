# GoFS - Go File System Library

GoFS is a powerful Go library for handling file system operations in various operating systems. Whether you're working on Windows, macOS, or Linux, GoFS provides a unified interface for managing files and directories with ease.

## Motivation

Managing file systems can be challenging, especially when dealing with differences across various operating systems. I built GoFS to provide a simple and consistent way to handle file system operations in Go, regardless of the underlying platform. By abstracting away the complexities of interacting with the file system, GoFS allows developers to focus on building robust applications without worrying about platform-specific intricacies.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** GoFS is designed to work seamlessly across different operating systems, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of the platform.
- **Simple and Intuitive API:** With a clean and intuitive API, GoFS makes it easy to perform common file system operations such as file creation, deletion, renaming, moving, copying, and directory management.
- **Comprehensive Functionality:** From basic file and directory operations to advanced features like searching, retrieving directory structures, and handling symbolic links, GoFS offers a wide range of functionalities to suit your needs.
- **Error Handling:** GoFS provides robust error handling mechanisms, allowing you to gracefully handle errors and failures during file system operations.
- **Efficient and Performant:** Built with performance in mind, GoFS optimizes file system operations for efficiency and speed, ensuring smooth performance even with large file systems.

## Installation

To use GoFS in your Go projects, simply import it using Go modules:

```bash
go get github.com/yourusername/gofs
```

## Usage

Here's a quick example demonstrating how to use GoFS to perform common file system operations:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/yourusername/gofs"
)

func main() {
    // Create a new file
    file := gofs.NewFile("/path/to/file.txt")
    err := file.CreateIfNotExists()
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
        return
    }

    // Write data to the file
    data := []byte("Hello, world!")
    err = file.Write(data)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
        return
    }

    // Read data from the file
    content, err := file.ReadAll()
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
        return
    }
    fmt.Println("File content:", string(content))
}
```
